## VectorVulnDetector
Welcome to the VectorVulnDetector GitHub repository!

This project aims to analyze if a code contains a specific vulnerability by converting it into a word embedding vector and evaluating its cosine similarity with another word embedding vector containing a known vulnerability. This process allows us to obtain a measure of probability on what percentage we are confident that the code analyzed contains a vulnerability.

The project is implemented in Python, and we use CodeBERT and Code2Vec for generating the word embedding vectors. We also use metrics.pairwise.cosine_similarity of scikit-learn for calculating the cosine similarity.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, you will need to have Python and scikit-learn installed on your machine. Once you have the necessary dependencies, you can clone the repository and start experimenting with the code.
