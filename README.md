## VectorVulnDetector
Welcome to the VectorVulnDetector GitHub repository!

This project aims to analyze if a code contains a specific vulnerability by converting it into a word embedding vector and evaluating its cosine similarity with another word embedding vector containing a known vulnerability. This process allows us to obtain a measure of probability on what percentage we are confident that the code analyzed contains a vulnerability.

The project is implemented in Python, and we use Code2Vec for generating the code embedding vectors. 

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, you will need to have Python and numpy installed on your machine. Once you have the necessary dependencies, you can clone the repository and start experimenting with the code.
